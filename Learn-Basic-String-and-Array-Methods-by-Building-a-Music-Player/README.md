# Introduction
Now let's learn some essential string and array methods like the find(), forEach(), map(), and join(). These methods are crucial for developing dynamic web applications.

In this project, you'll code a basic MP3 player using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project covers fundamental concepts such as handling audio playback, managing a playlist, implementing play, pause, next, previous, and shuffle functionalities. You'll even learn how to dynamically update your user interface based on the current song.

# Step 1
In this project you will learn basic string and array methods by building a music player app. You will be able to play, pause, skip, and shuffle songs.

The HTML and CSS of this project have been provided for you, so you can focus on the JavaScript.

Start by accessing the #playlist-songs, #play, and #pause elements with the getElementById() method. Assign them to variables playlistSongs, playButton and pauseButton respectively.
