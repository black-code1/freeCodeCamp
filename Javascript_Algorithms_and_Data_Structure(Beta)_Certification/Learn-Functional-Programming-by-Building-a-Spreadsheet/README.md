# Learn Functional Programming by Building a Spreadsheet

Functional Programming is a popular approach to software development. In Functional Programming, developers organize code into smaller functions, then combine those functions to build complex programs.

In this spreadsheet application project, you'll learn about parsing and evaluating mathematical expressions, implementing spreadsheet functions, handling cell references, and creating interactive web interfaces. You'll learn how to dynamically update the page based on user input.

This project will cover concepts like the map(), find(), and includes() methods and the parseInt() function.

# Step 1
Your project starts with a basic HTML container and some corresponding CSS. Your first task will be to programmatically generate the cells for your spreadsheet.

The global window object represents the browser window (or tab). It has an onload property which allows you to define behavior when the window has loaded the entire page, including stylesheets and scripts.

Start by setting the onload property of window to an arrow function with no parameters. In the function, declare a container variable and assign it the value of getting the element by the id of container.

# Step 2
Functions are ideal for reusable logic. When a function itself needs to reuse logic, you can declare a nested function to handle that logic. Here is an example of a nested function:

Example Code
```
const outer = () => {
const inner = () => {

};
};
```
Declare a nested createLabel function using arrow syntax. It should take a name parameter.

# Step 3
Remember that the document object has a .createElement() method which allows you to dynamically create new HTML elements.

In your createLabel function, declare a label variable and assign it a new div element.

# Step 4
Set the className of the label element to label, and set the textContent to the name parameter.

# Step 5
Finally, use the .appendChild() method to add your label element to the container element.

# Step 6
You will need a function to generate a range of numbers.

Declare an empty range function which takes a start and end parameter. Use the Array() constructor and implicitly return an empty array.

# Step 7
Your array will need to be the size of the range. You can calculate this by finding the difference between end and start, and adding 1 to the result.

Pass this calculation as the argument for your Array() constructor.

# Step 8
The Array() constructor has a .fill() method which can be used to fill an array with a value. You can use this to fill your array with the start value.

Chain the .fill() method to your Array() constructor, and pass it the start value.

# Step 9
Currently your range function returns an array with the correct length, but all of the values are the value of start. To fix this, chain the .map() method to your .fill() method.

Pass the .map() method a callback which takes element and index as parameters and returns the sum of those parameters.

# Step 10
Now that you have a range function, you can use it to create a range of letters as well.

Declare a charRange function using const and arrow syntax. It should take a start and end parameter. The function should implicitly return the result of calling range() with start and end as the arguments.

# Step 11
Your range function expects numbers, but your start and end values will be strings (specifically, they will be single characters such as A).

Convert your start and end values in your range() call to numbers by using the .charCodeAt() method on them, passing the number 0 as the argument to that method.

# Step 12
range() will return an array of numbers, which you need to convert back into characters. Chain the .map() method to your range() call.

Pass a callback function that takes code as the parameter and implicitly returns the value of passing code to the String.fromCharCode() method.

# Step 13
Now that your helper functions are complete, back in your onload event handler you should declare a letters variable. Assign it the result of calling charRange() with the letters A and J as arguments.

# Step 14
Now call the .forEach() method of your letters array, and pass your createLabel function reference as the callback.

You should see some letters appear across the top of your spreadsheet.

# Step 15
Remember that range() returns an array, so you can chain array methods directly to the function call.

Call range() with 1 and 99 as the arguments, and chain the .forEach() method. Pass the .forEach() method an empty callback which takes number as the parameter.

# Step 16
In your callback, you will need to make two function calls. Start by calling createLabel() and pass number as the argument. You should see some numbers appear in your spreadsheet.

Then call the .forEach() method on your letters array. Pass an empty callback function which takes a letter parameter.

# Step 17
Now in your nested .forEach() call, declare an input variable. Use the .createElement() method of the document object to create an input element. Set the type attribute to text and the id attribute to letter + number.

# Step 18
In earlier projects you learned about the setAttribute method. Another way to update an attribute in JavaScript is to use the following syntax:

Example Code
`el.attribute = value;`
The property names for hyphenated HTML attribute values, such as aria-label, follow camel case, becoming ariaLabel.

Example Code
`el.ariaLabel = "Aria Label Value";`
Set the aria-label attribute for the input element to the same value as the id attribute.

# Step 19
Append the input element to your container element as a child.

You should now be able to see the cells of your spreadsheet.

# Step 20
Most spreadsheet programs include built-in functions for calculation.

Declare a sum function that takes a nums parameter, which will be an array of numbers. It should return the result of calling reduce on the array to sum all of the numbers.

# Step 21
Declare an isEven function, which takes a num parameter and returns true if the number is even, and false otherwise. Use the modulo operator % to determine if a number is even or odd.

# Step 22
Declare an average function which takes an array of numbers as the nums parameter. It should return the average of all the numbers in the array.

The average can be calculated by dividing the sum of all the numbers in the array by the length of the array. Remember that you have a sum function you can use.

# Step 23
Your next function will calculate the median value of an array of numbers. Start by declaring a median arrow function that takes a nums parameter.

In the function, declare a sorted variable and assign it the value of sorting a copy of the nums array.

You should use the slice() method for creating a shallow copy of the array.

# Step 24
Now declare a length variable and assign it the length of your sorted array, and a middle variable that has the value of the length divided by 2, subtracted by 1.

# Step 25
Using ternary syntax, check if length is even using your isEven function. If it is, return the average of the number at the middle index and the number after that. If it's odd, return the number at the middle index â€“ you'll need to round the middle value up.

# Step 26
Object properties consist of key/value pairs. You can use shorthand property names when declaring an object literal. When using the shorthand property name syntax, the name of the variable becomes the property key and its value the property value.

The following example declares a user object with the properties userId, firstName, and loggedIn.

Example Code
```
const userId = 1;
const firstName = "John";
const loggedIn = true;

const user = {
userId,
firstName,
loggedIn,
};

console.log(user); // { userId: 1, firstName: 'John', loggedIn: true }
```
To keep track of all of your spreadsheet's functions, declare a spreadsheetFunctions object. Using the shorthand notation syntax, set sum, average, and median as properties on the spreadsheetFunctions object.

# Step 27
Now you can start using your spreadsheet functions. Begin by declaring an update arrow function. It should take an event parameter.

# Step 28
In your window.onload function, you need to tell your input elements to call the update function when the value changes. You can do this by directly setting the onchange property.

Set the onchange property to be a reference to your update function.

# Step 29
Since your update event is running as a change event listener, the event parameter will be a change event.

The target property of the change event represents the element that changed. Assign the target property to a new variable called element.

# Step 30
Because the change event is triggering on an input element, the element will have a value property that represents the current value of the input.

Assign the value property of element to a new variable called value, and use .replace() to remove all whitespace.

# Step 31
Now you need to check if the value does not include the id of the element. Create an if condition to do so.

# Step 32
Spreadsheet software typically uses = at the beginning of a cell to indicate a calculation should be used, and spreadsheet functions should be evaluated.

Use the && operator to add a second condition to your if statement that also checks if the first character of value is =.

# Step 33
In order to run your spreadsheet functions, you need to be able to parse and evaluate the input string. This is a great time to use another function.

Declare an evalFormula arrow function which takes the parameters x and cells.

# Step 34
In your evalFormula, declare an idToText arrow function which takes an id parameter.

Your idToText function should return the result of calling .find() on the cells array with a callback function that takes an cell parameter and returns cell.id === id.

Both of your functions should use implicit returns.

# Step 35
Your idToText function currently returns an input element. Update it to return the value of that input element.

# Step 36
You need to be able to match cell ranges in a formula. Cell ranges can look like A1:B12 or A3:A25. You can use a regular expression to match these patterns.

Start by declaring a rangeRegex variable and assign it a regular expression that matches A through J (the range of columns in your spreadsheet). Use a capture group with a character class to achieve this.

# Step 37
After matching a cell letter successfully, your rangeRegex needs to match the cell number. Cell numbers in your sheet range from 1 to 99.

Add a capture group after your letter capture group. Your new capture group should match one or two digits â€“ the first digit should be 1 through 9, and the second digit should be 0 through 9. The second digit should be optional.

# Step 38
Ranges are separated by a colon. After your two capture groups, your rangeRegex should look for a colon.

# Step 39
After your rangeRegex finds the :, it needs to look for the same letter and number pattern as it did before.

Copy your two existing capture groups and paste them after the colon.

# Step 40
Finally, make your rangeRegex global and case-insensitive.

# Step 41
Declare a rangeFromString arrow function that takes two parameters, num1 and num2. The function should implicitly return the result of calling range with num1 and num2 as arguments.

To be safe, parse num1 and num2 into integers as you pass them into range.

# Step 42
Declare a function elemValue which takes a num parameter. The function should be empty.

# Step 43
In your elemValue function, declare a function called inner which takes a character parameter.

Then, return your inner function.

# Step 44
In your inner function, return the result of calling idToText with character + num as the argument.

# Step 45
The concept of returning a function within a function is called currying. This approach allows you to create a variable that holds a function to be called later, but with a reference to the parameters of the outer function call.

For example:

Example Code
```
const innerOne = elemValue(1);
const final = innerOne("A");
```
innerOne would be your inner function, with num set to 1, and final would have the value of the cell with the id of A1. This is possible because functions have access to all variables declared at their creation. This is called closure.

You'll get some more practice with this. Declare a function called addCharacters which takes a character1 parameter.

# Step 46
In your elemValue function, you explicitly declared a function called inner and returned it. However, because you are using arrow syntax, you can implicitly return a function. For example:

Example Code
`const curry = soup => veggies => {};`
curry is a function which takes a soup parameter and returns a function which takes a veggies parameter. Using this syntax, update your addCharacters function to return an empty function which takes a character2 parameter.

# Step 47
Your inner functions can also return a function. Using the same arrow syntax, update your addCharacters function to return a third function which takes a num parameter.

# Step 48
Now update your innermost function in the addCharacters chain to implicitly return the result of calling charRange() with character1 and character2 as the arguments.

# Step 49
Use the same syntax as your addCharacters function to update your elemValue function. It should no longer declare inner, but should return the function implicitly.

# Step 50
Your addCharacters function ultimately returns a range of characters. You want it to return an array of cell ids. Chain the .map() method to your charRange() call. Do not pass a callback function yet.

# Step 51
You can pass a function reference as a callback parameter. A function reference is a function name without the parentheses. For example:

Example Code
```
const myFunc = (val) => `value: ${val}`;
const array = [1, 2, 3];
const newArray = array.map(myFunc);
```
The .map() method here will call the myFunc function, passing the same arguments that a .map() callback takes. The first argument is the value of the array at the current iteration, so newArray would be [value: 1, value: 2, value: 3].

Pass a reference to your elemValue function as the callback to your .map() method.

# Step 52
Because elemValue returns a function, your addCharacters function ultimately returns an array of function references. You want the .map() method to run the inner function of your elemValue function, which means you need to call elemValue instead of reference it. Pass num as the argument to your elemValue function.

# Step 53
Declare a rangeExpanded variable and assign it the result of calling the .replace() method of your x parameter. Pass the rangeRegex variable as the argument.

# Step 54
The second argument to the .replace() method does not have to be a string. You can instead pass a callback function to run more complex logic on the matched string.

The callback function takes a few parameters. The first is the matched string. Pass an empty callback function to your .replace() call, and give it a match parameter.

# Step 55
The callback function then has a parameter for each capture group in the regular expression. In your case, rangeRegex has four capture groups: the first letter, the first numbers, the second letter, and the second numbers.

Give your callback function four more parameters to match those capture groups: char1, num1, char2, and num2. char will be short for character.

# Step 56
Have your callback implicitly return the result of calling rangeFromString() with num1 and num2 as the arguments.

# Step 57
Call the .map() method on your rangeFromString() call, passing a reference to addCharacters as the callback function.

# Step 58
addCharacters returns a function, so you'll want to call it. Pass char1 as the argument.

# Step 59
Your addCharacters(char1) is also returning a function, which returns another function. You need to make another function call to access that innermost function reference for the .map() callback. JavaScript allows you to immediately invoke returned functions:

Example Code
`myFunc(1)("hi");`
Immediately invoke the function returned from your addCharacters(char1) call, and pass char2 as the argument.

# Step 60
Now that your .map() function is receiving the innermost function reference from addCharacters, it will properly iterate over the elements and pass each element as n to that function.

You'll notice that you are not using your match parameter. In JavaScript, it is common convention to prefix an unused parameter with an underscore _. You could also leave the parameter empty like so: (, char1) but it is often clearer to name the parameter for future readability.

Prefix your match parameter with an underscore.

# Step 61
Declare a variable cellRegex to match cell references. It should match a letter from A to J, followed by a digit from 1 to 9, and an optional digit from 0 to 9. Make the regular expression case-insensitive and global.

# Step 62
Declare a cellExpanded variable and assign it the value of calling .replace() on your rangeExpanded variable. Pass it your cellRegex and an empty callback function. The callback function should take a match parameter.

# Step 63
Update your callback function to return the result of calling idToText() with match as the argument. Remember that your regular expression is case-insensitive, so you will need to call toUpperCase() on match before passing it to idToText().

# Step 64
In mathematics, an infix is a mathematical operator that appears between its two operands. For example, 1 + 2 is an infix expression.

To parse these expressions, you will need to map the symbols to relevant functions. Declare an infixToFunction variable, and assign it an empty object.

# Step 65
Object values do not have to be primitive types, like a string or a number. They can also be functions.

Give your infixToFunction object a + property. That property should be a function that takes an x and y parameter and implicitly returns the sum of those two parameters.

Because + is not alphanumeric, you'll need to wrap it in quotes for your property.
