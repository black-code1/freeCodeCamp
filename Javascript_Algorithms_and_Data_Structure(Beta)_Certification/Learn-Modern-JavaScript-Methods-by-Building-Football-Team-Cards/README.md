# Learn Modern JavaScript Methods by Building Football Team Cards
One common aspect of building web applications: processing datasets, and then outputting information to the screen. In this sports team cards project, you'll learn how to work with DOM manipulation, object destructuring, event handling, and data filtering.

This project will cover concepts like switch statements, default parameters, Object.freeze(), the map() method, and more.

# Step 1
In this project, you will build a set of football team cards and learn about nested objects, object destructuring, default parameters, event listeners, and switch statements. All of the HTML and CSS for this project has been provided for you.

Start by accessing the id called "team" from the HTML document and storing it in a const variable called teamName.

Remember, you can use the getElementById method for this.

NOTE: The numbers for the team are organized alphabetically by last name. This differs from conventional numbering where the numbers correspond with what is on the player's jerseys.

# Step 2
Next, access the id called "sport" from the HTML document and store it in a const variable called typeOfSport. Below that variable, assign the id of "year" to a const variable called worldCupYear.

# Step 3
Next, access the id called "head-coach" from the HTML document and store it in a const variable called headCoach. Below that variable, assign the id of "player-cards" to a const variable called playerCards.

# Step 4
Create one more const variable called playersDropdownList and assign it the id of "players" using the getElementById method.

# Step 5
Now it is time to build out the data structure that will hold all of the information for your football team.

Below the variables you just created, create a new const variable called myFavoriteFootballTeam and assign it an empty object.

# Step 6
Inside the myFavoriteFootballTeam object, add a new property with a key named team and a string value of "Argentina".

# Step 7
Below the team property, add a new property with a key named sport and a string value of "Football".
