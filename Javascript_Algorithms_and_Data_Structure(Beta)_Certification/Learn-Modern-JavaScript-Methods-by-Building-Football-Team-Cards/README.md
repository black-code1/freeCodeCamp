# Learn Modern JavaScript Methods by Building Football Team Cards
One common aspect of building web applications: processing datasets, and then outputting information to the screen. In this sports team cards project, you'll learn how to work with DOM manipulation, object destructuring, event handling, and data filtering.

This project will cover concepts like switch statements, default parameters, Object.freeze(), the map() method, and more.

# Step 1
In this project, you will build a set of football team cards and learn about nested objects, object destructuring, default parameters, event listeners, and switch statements. All of the HTML and CSS for this project has been provided for you.

Start by accessing the id called "team" from the HTML document and storing it in a const variable called teamName.

Remember, you can use the getElementById method for this.

NOTE: The numbers for the team are organized alphabetically by last name. This differs from conventional numbering where the numbers correspond with what is on the player's jerseys.
