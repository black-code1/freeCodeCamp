# Learn Basic JavaScript by Building a Role Playing Game

## Step 1
To get started, create your standard HTML boilerplate with a DOCTYPE, html, head, and body, then add a meta tag for the charset. Add a title element and use the text RPG - Dragon Repeller for it. Include a link tag for your stylesheet to link the styles.css file.

Finally, create a div element with id set to game within your body.

## Step 2
Now you can start writing your JavaScript. Begin by creating a script element. This element is used to load JavaScript into your HTML file.

## step 3
Add a console.log("Hello World"); line between your script tags. Then click the "Console" button to open the console. You should see the text "Hello World".

## Step 4
Remove your console.log("Hello World"); line. Then give your now empty script element a src attribute set to ./script.js.

## Step 5
Add your console.log("Hello World"); line to this file, and see it appear in your console.

## Step 6
Use the let keyword to declare a variable called xp and assign it the value of 0, a number.

## Step 7
Initialize another variable called health with a value of 100, and a variable called gold with a value of 50.

## Step 8
Create another variable called currentWeaponIndex and set it to 0.

## Step 9
Declare a variable called fighting but do not initialize it with a value.
