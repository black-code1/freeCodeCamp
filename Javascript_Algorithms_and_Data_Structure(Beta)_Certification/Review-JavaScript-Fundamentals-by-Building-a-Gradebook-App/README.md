# Step 1
A teacher has finished grading their students' tests and needs your help to calculate the average score for the class.

Complete the getAverage function which takes in an array of test scores and returns the average score.

The average is calculated by adding up all the scores and dividing by the total number of scores.

# Step 2
Now the teacher needs your help converting the student score to a letter grade.

Complete the getGrade function that takes a number score as a parameter. Your function should return a string representing a letter grade based on the score.

Here are the scores and their corresponding letter grades:
| Score Range | Grade |
|-------------|-------|
| 100         | "A++" |
| 90 - 99     | "A"   |
| 80 - 89     | "B"   |
| 70 - 79     | "C"   |
| 60 - 69     | "D"   |
| 0 - 59      | "F"   |
