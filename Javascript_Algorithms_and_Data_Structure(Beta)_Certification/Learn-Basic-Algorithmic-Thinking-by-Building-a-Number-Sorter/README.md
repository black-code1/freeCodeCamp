# Learn Basic Algorithmic Thinking by Building a Number Sorter
In computer science, there are fundamental sorting algorithms that all developers should learn. In this number sorter project, you'll learn how to implement and visualize different sorting algorithms like bubble sort, selection sort, and insertion sort â€“ all with JavaScript.

This project will help you understand the fundamental concepts behind these algorithms, and how you can apply them to sort numerical data in web applications.

# Step 1
In this project, you will be building a number sorter. The HTML and CSS have been provided for you. Feel free to explore them.

When you are ready, declare a sortButton variable and assign it the value of .getElementById() with the argument "sort".

# Step 2
To prepare your project's logic, use const and arrow syntax to declare a sortInputArray function. It should take a single event parameter.
