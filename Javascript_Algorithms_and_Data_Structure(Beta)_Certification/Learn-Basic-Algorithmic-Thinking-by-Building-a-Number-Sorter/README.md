# Learn Basic Algorithmic Thinking by Building a Number Sorter
In computer science, there are fundamental sorting algorithms that all developers should learn. In this number sorter project, you'll learn how to implement and visualize different sorting algorithms like bubble sort, selection sort, and insertion sort â€“ all with JavaScript.

This project will help you understand the fundamental concepts behind these algorithms, and how you can apply them to sort numerical data in web applications.

# Step 1
In this project, you will be building a number sorter. The HTML and CSS have been provided for you. Feel free to explore them.

When you are ready, declare a sortButton variable and assign it the value of .getElementById() with the argument "sort".

# Step 2
To prepare your project's logic, use const and arrow syntax to declare a sortInputArray function. It should take a single event parameter.

# Step 3
You will be using this as an event listener for the sortButton. Because buttons associated with a form element submit by default, you need to prevent that behavior. Call event.preventDefault() in your function to do this.

# Step 4
To test your code as you write it, mount an event listener to your sortButton element. It should listen for the "click" event, and take sortInputArray as the callback.

# Step 5
Back in your sortInputArray function, you need to get the values from your select elements. Since they all have the class values-dropdown, you can query them all at once.

Use document.getElementsByClassName() to get all the elements with this class by passing in the argument "values-dropdown". Assign that to an inputValues variable with const.

# Step 6
Remember that .getElementsByClassName() returns an array-like object. You can use the spread operator to convert it into an array.

Convert the document.getElementsByClassName() call to an array with the spread operator and assign it to a variable called inputValues.

# Step 7
You need to get the values from your select elements. These values will currently be strings and you will convert them into numbers.

Use the map function to iterate over the array. Pass a callback function to map that takes a dropdown parameter and returns dropdown.value.

# Step 8
You should use console.log() to print out the result of inputValues. Write the code for this inside the sortInputArray function.

To see the result for the inputValues array, log out the inputValues array to the console. Then click on the sort button and open up the console. You should see an array of strings like this:

Example Code
`[ '8', '2', '4', '1', '3' ]`
Before going further, make sure you observe the data type of the printed result in the console.

In the next step, you will convert those strings into numbers.

# Step 9
Update your .map() callback to call the Number() function. Pass dropdown.value to that function call.

Open the Console tab to see that your inputValues is an array of numbers now.

# Step 10
Now that you have confirmed the data type of the inputValues elements, remove your console.log() call.

# Step 11
You need a function to update the display with the sorted numbers. Start by using arrow syntax to declare an updateUI function that takes a single array parameter.

Because you will be writing algorithms that won't immediately have a return value, set a fallback value for array to be an empty array. Here is an example of a function that has a fallback value:

Example Code
`const myFunction = (string = "") => {

}`

# Step 12
To perform an action on each element in the array, use the method that is meant for iterating over arrays.

Use the forEach() method, and pass it an empty callback which takes num and i as the parameters.

# Step 13
Create a variable named outputValueNode and set its value to the result of calling the document.getElementById() method. Use template literal syntax to pass in the output-value-${i} string to .getElementById().

# Step 14
Set the innerText property of outputValueNode to num.

# Step 15
In your sortInputArray() function, call your updateUI() function and pass inputValues as the argument.

You should now be able to click the Sort button and see the inputted array in the Output section.

# Step 16
Now you need to actually sort the array. The first sorting algorithm you will implement is the bubble sort, which starts at the beginning of the array and 'bubbles up' unsorted values towards the end, iterating through the array until it is completely sorted.

Begin by declaring a bubbleSort variable and assigning it an arrow function that takes an array parameter.

# Step 17
You'll need to iterate through the array. For simplicity, use a for loop to do so.

# Step 18
Because you need to compare elements, you'll need to use a nested for loop. This loop should iterate through every element in the array except the last one. Use j as your inner loop's iterator variable.

# Step 19
For debugging purposes, add a console.log() call in your inner loop. Pass it the arguments array, array[j], and array[j+1].

# Step 20
In your sortInputArray() function, declare a sortedValues variable. Assign it the value of calling bubbleSort with your inputValues array.

Then, update your updateUI call to pass sortedValues as the argument.

# Step 21
To achieve the "bubble up" result, you need to check if the current element is larger than the next element. You can do this by accessing the array at j and j+1.

Create an if condition that checks if the current element is larger than the next element.

# Step 22
When your if condition is true, you need to swap the two elements, "bubbling" the larger element up toward the end of the array.

To do this, declare a temp variable and assign it the value of array[j]. Then assign array[j] the value of array[j + 1]. Finally, assign array[j + 1] the value of temp.

# Step 23
Finally, after your outer loop has finished executing, return the sorted array.

# Step 24
Click your Sort button to see your bubble sort algorithm in action! If you open the console, you can watch the steps the algorithm takes.

Now that you have confirmed it works, remove your console.log() call.

# Step 25
Time to implement another sorting algorithm. This time, you'll be implementing a selection sort. Selection sort works by finding the smallest value in the array, then swapping it with the first value in the array. Then, it finds the next smallest value in the array, and swaps it with the second value in the array. It continues iterating through the array until it is completely sorted.

Start by declaring a selectionSort variable and assigning it an arrow function that takes an array parameter.

# Step 26
Update your sortedValues variable to be the result of calling selectionSort instead of bubbleSort.

# Step 27
Like a bubble sort, a selection sort needs to iterate through the array. Declare a for loop to do so.

# Step 28
A selection sort relies on tracking the index of the smallest value in the array. Declare a variable minIndex and set it to i - this ensures that if your current value is the smallest, it will be swapped with itself and not be moved. You will need to be able to reassign the value of minIndex as you iterate through the array.

Then, write another for loop, using j as the iterator. This loop needs to start at the index after i and iterate through the rest of the array.

# Step 29
Inside your nested for loop, add a console.log() call to check the values of array, array[j], and array[minIndex] at each iteration. You can click the Sort button to see how your algorithm is traversing the array.

Then write an if statement that checks if the value at array[j] is smaller than the value at array[minIndex]. If it is, set minIndex to j.

# Step 30
After your nested for loop, you've found the smallest value. You need to swap it with your current value.

Like you did in your bubble sort, use a temp variable to extract the value at array[i], then swap the values at array[i] and array[minIndex].

# Step 31
Finally, after your outer loop has finished, you need to return the array. Once you've done so, you should be able to see the Output change when you click the Sort button again.

# Step 32
With your selection sort now functional, remove your console.log() statement.

# Step 33
The last sorting algorithm you will implement is the insertion sort. This algorithm works by building up a sorted array at the beginning of the list. It begins the sorted array with the first element. Then it inspects the next element and swaps it backward into the sorted array until it is in a sorted position, and so on.

Start by declaring an insertionSort variable and assigning it an arrow function which takes an array parameter.

# Step 34
As before, update your sortedValues variable to be the result of insertionSort instead of selectionSort.

# Step 35
An insertion sort algorithm starts the sort at the beginning of the list, meaning the first element is already sorted. With this in mind, create a for loop that starts at the second element in the array - it should still iterate through the rest of the array.

# Step 36
Declare a currValue variable and assign it the value at array[i]. Then, declare a j variable and assign it i - 1. Your j variable should be re-assignable.

# Step 37
For this algorithm, you'll want to use a while loop. This loop needs two conditions:

- First, it should not run beyond the beginning of the array (accessed with j).
- Second, the loop should not run after it finds a value smaller than the current value.
To prevent an infinite loop, decrement j inside your loop.
# Step 38
On each iteration of your while loop, it is finding an element that is larger than your current value. You need to move that element to the right to make room for your current value.

Do so by assigning the value at the j index to the next index.

# Step 39
After your while loop, you need to insert your current value. Remember that your loop ends when j is either out of the array bounds, or when the value at j is less than your current value.

Use the assignment operator to insert your current value into the correct index.

# Step 40
After your for loop has finished, you need to return the array. You should then be able to see the Output change when you click the Sort button again.

# Step 41
To sort the elements of an array, you can use the built-in method called .sort(). Therefore, you can update the sortedValues variable by assigning it the result of calling .sort() on the inputValues array.
