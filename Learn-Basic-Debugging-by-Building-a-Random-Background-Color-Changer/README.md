Debugging is the process of going through your code, finding any issues, and fixing them.

In this project, you will help CamperBot build a random background color changer and help them find and fix errors.

# Step 1
CamperBot is trying to build out a random background color changer. But they keep running into issues and need your help to debug the code.

CamperBot has already added the HTML and CSS for the project. But they are confused as to why none of the styles and content is showing up on the page.

Example Code
`SyntaxError: unknown: Unexpected token, expected ","`
Syntax errors are thrown when the JavaScript engine encounters something it can't interpret. In this case, it looks like CamperBot has syntax errors in the darkColorsArr array.

Fix the syntax errors in the darkColorsArr array and you should see the content and styles show up on the page.
